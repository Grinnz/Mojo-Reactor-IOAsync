=head1 NAME

Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync - IO::Async backend for Mojo::Reactor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync;

  # Watch if handle becomes readable or writable
  my $reactor = Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync->new;
  $reactor->io($handle => sub {
    my ($reactor, $writable) = @_;
    say $writable ? 'Handle is writable' : 'Handle is readable';
  });

  # Change to watching only if handle becomes writable
  $reactor->watch($handle, 0, 1);

  # Add a timer
  $reactor->timer(15 => sub {
    my $reactor = shift;
    $reactor->remove($handle);
    say 'Timeout!';
  });

  # Start reactor if necessary
  $reactor->start unless $reactor->is_running;

  # Or in an application using Mojo::IOLoop
  use Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync;
  use Mojo::IOLoop;
  
  # Or in a Mojolicious application
  $ MOJO_REACTOR=Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync hypnotoad script/myapp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync> is an event reactor for L<Mojo::IOLoop> that uses
L<IO::Async>. The usage is exactly the same as other L<Mojo::Reactor>
implementations such as L<Mojo::Reactor::Poll>. L<Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync> will
be used as the default backend for L<Mojo::IOLoop> if it is loaded before
L<Mojo::IOLoop> or any module using the loop. However, when invoking a
L<Mojolicious> application through L<morbo> or L<hypnotoad>, the reactor must
be set as the default by setting the C<MOJO_REACTOR> environment variable to
C<Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync>.

=head1 EVENTS

L<Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync> inherits all events from L<Mojo::Reactor>.

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::Reactor> and
implements the following new ones.

=head2 again

  $reactor->again($id);

Restart active timer.

=head2 io

  $reactor = $reactor->io($handle => sub {...});

Watch handle for I/O events, invoking the callback whenever handle becomes
readable or writable.

=head2 is_running

  my $bool = $reactor->is_running;

Check if reactor is running.

=head2 new

  my $reactor = Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync->new;

Construct a new L<Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync> object.

=head2 one_tick

  $reactor->one_tick;

Run reactor until an event occurs or no events are being watched anymore. Note
that this method can recurse back into the reactor, so you need to be careful.

=head2 recurring

  my $id = $reactor->recurring(0.25 => sub {...});

Create a new recurring timer, invoking the callback repeatedly after a given
amount of time in seconds.

=head2 remove

  my $bool = $reactor->remove($handle);
  my $bool = $reactor->remove($id);

Remove handle or timer.

=head2 reset

  $reactor->reset;

Remove all handles and timers.

=head2 start

  $reactor->start;

Start watching for I/O and timer events, this will block until L</"stop"> is
called or no events are being watched anymore. See L</"CAVEATS">.

=head2 stop

  $reactor->stop;

Stop watching for I/O and timer events.

=head2 timer

  my $id = $reactor->timer(0.5 => sub {...});

Create a new timer, invoking the callback after a given amount of time in
seconds.

=head2 watch

  $reactor = $reactor->watch($handle, $readable, $writable);

Change I/O events to watch handle for with true and false values. Note that
this method requires an active I/O watcher.

=head1 CAVEATS

When using L<Mojo::IOLoop> with L<IO::Async>, the event loop must be controlled
by L<Mojo::IOLoop> or L<Mojo::Reactor::IOAsync>, such as with the methods
L</"start">, L</"stop">, and L</"one_tick">. Starting or stopping the event
loop through L<IO::Async> will not provide required functionality to
L<Mojo::IOLoop> applications.

Externally-added L<IO::Async> notifiers will keep the L<Mojo::IOLoop> loop
running if they are added to the event loop as a notifier, see
L<IO::Async::Loop/"NOTIFIER MANAGEMENT">.
